Description: A valuable package for users - particulary R-newbies - who need
    to analyse the udder health of dairy cow herds using somatic cell count data
    from Dairy Herd Improvement Tests. The main function 'monitor_SCCUdderHealth()'
    reads ADIS/ADED coded data, automatically generates a pretty report with
    the most relevant indicators for the udder health, and provides a csv-file with
    the udder health status of all cows.
